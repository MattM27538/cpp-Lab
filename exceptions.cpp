/*What catch blocks typically do
  1. Catch blocks may print an error (either to the console, or a log file) and then allow the
     function to proceed.
  2. Catch blocks may return a value or error code back to the caller.
  3. A catch block may throw another exception. Because the catch block is outside of the 
     try block, the newly thrown exception in this case is not handled by the preceding try 
     block -- itâ€™s handled by the next enclosing try block.
  4. A catch block in main() may be used to catch fatal errors and terminate the program in a 
     clean way.

      A try block must have at least one catch block immediately following it, but may have multiple
