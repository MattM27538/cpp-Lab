/*A function template is a function-like definition that is used to generate
* one or more overloaded functions, each with a different set of actual types.
* The initial function template that is used to generate other functions is 
* called the primary template. For each type template parameter, we use the 
* keyword typename (preferred) or class, followed by the name of the type 
* template parameter whcih acts as a placeholder type(e.g. T).

/*Function templates are not actually functions -- their code isnâ€™t compiled or 
* executed directly. Instead, function templates have one job: to generate 
* functions (that are compiled and executed). A function template is only 
* instantiated the first time a function call is made in each translation unit.
* Further calls to the function are routed to the already instantiated function.
